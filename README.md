# Final Project and Implementations for INDE577 

These are implementations of supervised and unsupervised learning from the INDE577 class. The machine learning algorithms implemented in this repository, include:
### Supervised Learning 
- Decision Trees
- Ensemble Learning
- Gradient Descent
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks (MLP regression) 
- Perceptron

### Unsupervised Learning
- PCA
- K Means Clustering

## Setup and Environment
It's important to use a virtual environment for many [reasons](https://csguide.cs.princeton.edu/software/virtualenv), and that's what I recommend for running these. I'm using the Anaconda Package Manager, which you can download [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/pkg-docs/).Specifically, I use miniconda, which is more than enough for my purposes. 

### Packages to install 
Once you have miniconda or anaconda installed, you can install the following packages after you've created the environment by doing the following in the command line. 

`conda create -n [YOUR ENVIRONMENT NAME HERE]` 

`conda init` (if you haven't already)

`conda activate [YOUR ENVIRONMENT NAME HERE]` 

`conda install numpy`
`conda install matplotlib`
`conda install scipy`
`conda install scikit-learn`
`conda install pandas` 
`pip install ucimlrepo`
