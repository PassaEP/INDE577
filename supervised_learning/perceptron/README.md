# Single Perceptron Implementation

This project demonstrates the implementation of a single perceptron, which is one of the fundamental building blocks of artificial neural networks. A perceptron is a simple binary classifier that takes multiple input features and produces a binary output.

## Overview

A perceptron consists of three main components:
- **Input layer**: The input layer receives input features, each of which is associated with a weight.
- **Activation function**: The activation function computes the weighted sum of inputs and applies a threshold to produce the output.
- **Weights**: Weights are adjustable parameters that the perceptron learns during the training process.

## Implementation

The implementation of the single perceptron includes the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize the weights and bias term.
2. **Forward Pass**: Compute the weighted sum of inputs and apply the activation function to produce the output.
3. **Training**: Update the weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs using the perceptron learning rule.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained perceptron to make predictions on new data.

## Problem

Here, we use the perceptron to look at 2 distinct features from the tumor dataset and try to see if there's a distinct decision boundary.
